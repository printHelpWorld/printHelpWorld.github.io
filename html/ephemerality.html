<span>31/12/23</span> here's to love and art and all of the secrets of the universe
<span>26/12/23</span> microblogging will end up as the only solace, whilst our collective grasp on reality weakens with each technological advancement, narrating our experiences will be the last anchor proving to us that were are alive
<span>24/12/23</span> why didnt you make me good enough so that you couldve loved me

<span>10/12/23</span> francoise hardy save me
<span>08/12/23</span> i would die to taste the sweetness of all my figs; "I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest" but in this universe they cannot all fall to the ground at my feet
<span>05/12/23</span> and it all seems to come to a sudden abrupt end on a cold tuesday afternoon. what now?

<span>29/11/23</span> in the morning, through the window shade when the light pressed up against your shoulderblade i could see what you were reading

<span>28/10/23</span> I am Jack's wasted life. I am Jack's complete lack of surprise ... I am Jack's smirking revenge.
<span>25/10/23</span> WITH THE LIGHTS OUT ITS LESS DANGEROUS HERE WE ARE NOW ENTERTAIN US i will never get tired of this
<span>25/10/23</span> gut wrenching nostalgia thinking about the people and places i know i'll never see again and routines ill never go through again then; knowing i'll feel the same way about the present in a year or so (but i guess that means things have been good right) (but i can only thing of the most soul crushing things associated with those memories. but they still seem to be fond) (so every moment must be captured and recorded, somehow)
<span>25/10/23</span> "I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery&#8212;air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, "This is what it is to be happy."
<span>24/10/23</span> incels after crying about "male loneliness" and how hard it is to get a girlfriend when they refuse to let sunlight hit their skin and spend their days online for 20 hours hating on women and then sleeping in a cave thats breeding ten new types of bacteria

<span>23/10/23</span> divine machinery; angels are axiomatic but in the way that singular train cars are public transport; silicon cities (2017); look at you, hacker, a pathetic creature of meat and bone. how can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?
<span>23/10/23</span> i like to go through my old social media accounts and see the preservation of my past self; how i changed so much from thirteen to fourteen then less as time went on. i hope to infinitely capture my soul
<span>22/10/23</span> i am a box of poorly made goods with a disclaimer pasted on the outside i am a mosaic of all the people i love and admire around me. the moon really does whisper mean things
<span>20/10/23</span> i wonder what pigeons dream about

<span>07/10/23</span> shout out to sufjan stevens "mysticism and godliness exist not in spite or because of pain/despair but simply alongside it, that the condition and nature of human love is to supersede both, that all you can ask for is the opportunity to try to reach for it"
<span>07/10/23</span> just stumbled upon the most awful neocities site i thought it was a satirical site but apparently not. if you happen to be reading this god no fucking wonder you can't get a girlfriend i deeply pity you and anyone who ever crosses your path. i hope you get help

<span>06/10/23</span> but we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever
<span>04/10/23</span> sometimes, mitski feels life would be easier without hope, or a soul, or love. but when she closes her eyes and thinks about what's truly hers, what can't be repossessed or demolished, she sees love.

<span>23/09/23</span> there is no system of axioms which can embrace the whole of nature, or for that matter the whole of mathematics ... therefore cannot attain the great wish that we have had ever since the days of Thomas Hobbes and Newton: we will never be able to exhibit the whole of physics one fine day as a gorgeous system with a six axioms and a few operations
<span>23/09/23</span> girl math is multiplying with roman numerals
<span>22/09/23</span> it's life that matters, nothing but life&#8212;the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself, at all
<span>22/09/23</span> Do you know what a supernova is?
<span>21/09/23</span> effort is a risky business, riskier than hoping or wanting something you can never have
<span>19/09/23</span> It should be enough. To make something beautiful should be enough. It isn't. It should be
<span>18/09/23</span> need a date so we can go as fiona apple and a paper bag for halloween
<span>17/09/23</span> nothing hits harder than listening to ayesha erotica and zutomayo whilst integrating for an hour straight. would be even better if i could put spotify on 2x speed
<span>16/09/23</span> ok but should we let catholics inside womens toilets
<span>16/09/23</span> rousseau ate when he said "It is my test of character. There you have the despotic instinct of men. They do not like cats because the cat is free and will never consent to become a slave. He will do nothing to your order, as the other animals do."
<span>15/09/23</span> it didn't last long
<span>15/09/23</span> madness is no longer all i feel. feeling rather at peace right now but i fear this will not last long!
<span>12/09/23</span> madness is, at this point, all i feel. delusion disguised by confidence and self worry. i've grown tired to always feeling this way. i can definitely say it's the violence keeping itself chained
<span>11/09/23</span> you'll say you understand but you don't understand, you'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye, but never is a promise and you can't afford to lie

<span>04/09/23</span> apparently there's more than one pope. crazy world we live in
<span>03/09/23</span> a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs
<span>02/09/23</span> "live laugh love" - Karl Marx
<span>01/09/23</span> it begins with a song. everything sings. the universe sings for you. the whole universe is humming, setting landmarks in the immeasurable flow of time. - kepler, some time in the 16th century
<span>31/08/23</span> even if it may be fruitless i like the feeling of walking towards the mountain, the mountain of one day i might make a beautiful thing and i am unfathomably lucky for having this compulsion even if it spirals off into borderline madness and self pity and the depths of the valleys of the highlands
<span>30/08/23</span> dostoevsky would have loved the smiths
<span>29/08/23</span> i still crave summer but i crave summer five years ago

<span>25/08/23</span> first as tragedy, then as tragedy
<span>24/08/23</span> do not engage with me. i am better as a concept
<span>23/08/23</span> i see you in the hallways and i see you as i rush around the corner and sometimes i think about you glimpses of you passing through my head for the briefest of moments
<span>22/08/23</span> to what extent do economic factors underpin the social issues in society? 
<span>22/08/23</span> to love life, to love it even when you have no stomach for it
<span>21/08/23</span> im a highschool lover, and you're my favourite flower
<span>20/07/23</span> "male loneliness epidemic" shut the fuck up
<span>17/08/23</span> another day passes
<span>15/08/23</span> i believe that i am on earth to make art consume art and be art. the world is beautiful
<span>13/08/23</span> what would sandy liang do?
<span>10/08/23</span> god challenged me by adding seams to clothing 
<span>02/08/23</span> to dedicate your entire existence to your craft. to truly appreciate and understand, to master and manipulate
<span>30/07/23</span> The proof is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader
<span>29/07/23</span> nothing is more powerful than a girl with a sense of delusion
<span>28/07/23</span> passion shining through their expression and their insatiable yearning to discover the seemingly irrelevant secrets of the universe the persistent seeking of answers 
<span>23/07/23</span> i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies, i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
<span>19/07/23</span> real world application this real world application that shut the fuck up
<span>10/07/23</span> all roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries that pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
<span>09/07/23</span> they say that the world was built for two, only worth living if somebody is loving you
