                <p>"The point is not to ignore the author’s life or pretend it doesn’t exist. Even if that were possible, it wouldn’t accomplish anything. Rather, the point is that the author doesn’t get any special authority over the work...Chinatown is as much Dederer’s as it is Polanski’s; classic albums like 808s & Heartbreak are as much mine, or yours, as they are Ye’s. It’s a lovely, anarchistic idea. In practice, though, the idea has limits. There’s a certain category of art that defies any attempt at separation: namely, the cases where the horrible thing about the artist is present in the art itself"</p>

The US, on the other hand – which supplies about 80% of Israel’s weapons imports, as well as billions of dollars in aid – is treated as a kind of neutral third party, and of course as a “very good friend”. This way, our Government can bask in the moral glow of condemning the bombers, while preserving a cosy relationship with those supplying the bombs."</p>

                <p>"...if you take stock of the progress in neuroscience since 2000, it’s noticeable that the most popular papers are more aptly described as “cool” rather than fundamental. If you look at, say, Scientific American’s 2022 list of “This year’s most thought-provoking brain discoveries,” the results are firmly in the cool category, not the fundamental. ...What if we get more objective and examine the most-cited articles published since 2021 in the journal Neuroscience? The pattern continues. Cool, you can use micro-RNA to promote spinal cord regeneration in rats! Cool, you can use deep learning to help diagnose cognitive impairment using fMRI! Fundamental? No."</p>

                <p>"And, unfortunately, it has become endemic, infecting every space of discourse, and ensuring that actual progress, actual mutual understanding between people and cultures, never happens. We have sacrificed a focus on material betterment for moral purity."</p>
                <p><i>this reminds me of a forum based website i used to spend a lot of time on, but also the general state of the internet too, perhaps at a lesser scale.</i></p>

                <p>"the aesthetics of consumption have, in turn, become a conduit to make the self more easily consumable: your existence as a Type of Girl has almost nothing to do with whether you actually read joan didion or wear miu miu, and everything to do with whether you want to be seen as the type of person who would."</p>

                <p>"Whatever it means in theory, in practice capital punishment means killing innocent people."</p>
                <p><i>i think that theory is fun to discuss but this essay does well in providing detailed examples of the flaws of today's justice systems which often gets overlooked as a key reason against capital punishment where people are often caught up in moral arguments. rather, the moral question should be whether or not capital punishment should be allowed under a perfect, bias free justice system.</i></p>
