 <p style="left: 3px; width: 540px; top: 300px;">made a trip to the v&a for the first time in a while;
 found some unexplored or perhaps new areas of the museum, including their fashion (through history) collection.<br>
 some favourites pictured, from left to right: 1954 balmain hand painted silk dress, 1953 norman hartnell beaded dress, 1940 schiaparelli embroidered lily crepe dress</p>

<b>^ letterboxd year in review</b>: i watched asteroid city when it was first released but i wasn't really drawn to it which put me off anderson's other films for a while. however later in the year, after he released his shorts (which i adored and is almost certainly why he's my most watched director), i watched more of his older work which didn't feel as heavily visually stylised, which i preferred.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 175px;"><b>a good month in film. ></b></span>

<p style="left: 385px; top: 10px; width: 505px;">
i started writing in a journal again; i think the last time i consistently kept a diary was over three years ago.
i enjoy documenting my life but i've increasingly realised that neocities really isn't the perfect place for that - instead, neocities will become more of a place to document interests and to record slightly ambiguous thoughts that don't quite fit into a diary.
<br><Br>
this month *, it's something that had been built up to for a very long time but i can't do anything about it anymore so really i just need to get a grip and get over it. hoping for * to happen in february or march
<br><Br>
not a great month for productivity/studying, which hopefully will change in the next few months, but i picked up crochet, read lots of interesting articles and essays, and watched too many films

i made a few crochet doilies to learn the basics of crochet; i can't seem to stop now. planning to make a stargazer lily bouquet over the next few months, with sprigs of geranium and tiny ferns. filet crochet is also high on the list, i'm very partial to the idea of a filet crochet placemat spelling out cunt in calligraphy</p>

<b>things i liked about barcelona</b><br>
- the street art, there were so many beautiful works throughout the city. <span class="hover-word"><U>this</U></span> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7LERqAs.jpg" style="height: 150px; right: 20px; top: 40px;" class="image">
particular work was positioned next to a larger kiss mural comprised of thousands of smaller tiles with photographs of personal moments sent in from random people. i liked the blue tile painting because it appears to be clearly painted by an actual person so it felt more intimate; it's been through multiple fixes simply from random artists after people have destroyed the work by drawing dicks over it presumably with homophobic intent and i think it tells a certain simple story of resilience and love <br>
- whatever gaudi was doing. i liked seeing his work because it was full of colourful painted tiles and stained glass and those are the things i absolutely must have in my house when i'm older. i was worried about sagrada familia being a shitty tourist trap but it definitely wasn't, (but we did have lunch at a shitty tourist trap restaurant just outside the cathedral) the inside was so incredible, esp the stained glass windows which exploit the natural light to beautifully illuminate the cathedral. crazy what people managed to do in the name of religion. only downside was that at one point my nose started bleeding <br>
- montserrat. we spent the day visiting their monastery (again, crazy what people managed to do in the name of religion) then hiking up the mountains (i did this in a miniskirt and legwarmers because i was anticipating little stone stairs not steep rocky slopes) which was honestly such a fun journey and so worth it for the views <br>
- the chocolate croissants in our hotel, and the hotel itself, which was situated in central barcelona and had pretty architecture that my mother didn't like (terracotta flooring, warm dim lighting & a dark green tiled bathroom) <br>
- the christmas lights at night, the city seemed so alive at night moreso than during the day and there were so many interesting people which often left me in a state of sonder. it made me decide that i really fucking love big cities and that i definitely would like to live in one at some point when i'm older. building on this i thought that barcelona in particular had really good city planning regarding walkability and public transport in comparison to other major cities ive visited eg. london.<br>
- improved my relationship with my parents

for the third year in a row, i finished the year off with writing a ten page letter to myself reflecting on the past year but also on the upcoming one too.
i was too sick (spent the majority of the day curled up in bed playing the nyt crossword) to go to my friend's nye party so i stayed at home and watched the fireworks with my family at night.<br>
2024 will definitely be a year of some of the biggest changes in my life (university and moving out) but i hope it is kind to me.
